# Dictionary-App
Dictionary application implemented in the form of GUI using python. Interactive dictionary with correction of the misspelled word.
Executable file of the application has been uploaded as well.
data.json file is the database for the dictionary application.
Later on I'll update a section to include word that is not included into the database.
Any commits for that would appreciated, else I'll do the same later on.

pip install pyinstaller 
in your system
follow up the following code and you can generate an executable file
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed file_name.py

--windowed omits the command terminal operation
--onefile integrates the application and data for the application into a single file.
